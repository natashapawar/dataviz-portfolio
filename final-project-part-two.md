# Wireframes / storyboards

[ShortHand Wireframe](https://preview.shorthand.com/zed4GBSSytJbY5e1/responsive/desktop)

> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

I am still working on my visualizations to ascertain exactly what data would make my story the most compelling, as well as ensuring that the examples I use to support my story are universally known.

# User Research 

As I begin to start seeking user feedback, I hope to start gain better insight into whether my intended story is being reflected, and what I can do to update and enhance the user experience. Since data for this particular topic is a little hard to find, I will beging my narrowing my scope and identifying exactly which franchises and standalones I am trying to show, and ensuring that focus is supporting the story I am trying to tell. I also want to test whether the story resonates with my intended audiences.

## Target Audience:

- General Public: Casual book readers and movie watchers who consume content that is interesting to them, not specifically inclined to one or the other, however, those who have industry knowledge and frequently engage with discourse related to their preferred content. 
- Literary Fiction Fans: Individuals who consume both literary content as well as watch films and TV and fall at the intersection of the two. For these individuals, my primary focus is identifying whether they enjoy seeing their favorite fiction come to life, what they like about it, points of concerns and what industry leaders can do differently to ensure their needs are met.
- Industry Professionals: Stakeholders who are interested in knowing where to put their money when it comes to creating, acquiring and developing new content that resonates with a wide range of audiences. In addition to this, stakeholders who are in the publishing industry who are seeking film and TV professionals to help them adapt and bring their content to live-action.

Keeping these audiences in mind, I want to interview users who fall into each category and ensure that the information I am providing resonates and provides value to each group.
