# About Me

<img align="left" src="Natasha image.jpeg" width="150"/>


🪷 **Name:** Natasha Pawar

⭐ **Pronouns:** She/Her/Hers

👩🏻‍🎓 **Eduation:** Master of Entertainment Industry Management, Carnegie Mellon University

🎥 **Currently (Re)Watching:** White Collar (for the 5th time)

📖 **Currently Reading:** Yellowface by R.F. Kuang







Growing up, I’ve always been captivated by stories — they’ve been the guiding force in everything I’ve chosen to pursue. In my undergraduate years at UC Davis, I studied Psychology, Communication, and Human Development, fields that explore the intricacies of human behavior and interaction. I wanted to learn the "why" behind people’s decisions, a foundation that proved invaluable during my ~2 years working in consulting for the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications sector. Whether developing strategies or analyzing trends, I continued to find myself drawn to the power of stories, those of consumers, businesses, and industries, and how they could inform impactful decisions.

Now, as a graduate student at CMU pursuing a degree in the Entertainment Management sector, I have the unique opportunity to blend together both the creativite and analytical facets of storytelling. Upon graduation, I hope to pursue a career in strategy, consumer insights, or acquisitions and development for TV/streaming. I’m passionate about creating stories that resonate, whether through analyzing data to understand an audience or helping bring a new series to life and I look forward to learning and further developing my skillset in the weeks to come!

# What I Hope to Learn
Through the course of the Telling Stories with Data class, I seek to explore how different narratives can emerge from the same data set and how this can shape decision making. In addition to this, I hope to:
- Build my understanding of GitHub and Tableau
- Refine my skills in critiquing and analyzing data
- Develop compelling and persuasive data visualizations for different audiences

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
