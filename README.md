Growing up, I‚Äôve always been captivated by stories ‚Äî they‚Äôve been the guiding force in everything I‚Äôve chosen to pursue. In my undergraduate years at UC Davis, I studied Psychology, Communication, and Human Development, fields that explore the intricacies of human behavior and interaction. I wanted to learn the "why" behind people‚Äôs decisions, a foundation that proved invaluable during my ~2 years working in consulting for the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications sector. Whether developing strategies or analyzing trends, I continued to find myself drawn to the power of stories, those of consumers, businesses, and industries, and how they could inform impactful decisions.

Now, as a graduate student at CMU pursuing a degree in the Entertainment Management sector, I have the unique opportunity to blend together both the creativite and analytical facets of storytelling. Upon graduation, I hope to pursue a career in strategy, consumer insights, or acquisitions and development for TV/streaming. I‚Äôm passionate about creating stories that resonate, whether through analyzing data to understand an audience or helping bring a new series to life and I look forward to learning and further developing my skillset in the weeks to come!

# What I Hope to Learn
Through the course of the Telling Stories with Data class, I seek to explore how different narratives can emerge from the same data set and how this can shape decision making. In addition to this, I hope to:
- Build my understanding of GitHub and Tableau
- Refine my skills in critiquing and analyzing data
- Develop compelling and persuasive data visualizations for different audiences
