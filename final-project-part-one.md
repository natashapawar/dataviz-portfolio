# Final Project Part 1

## From Print to Picture: Analyzing the Impact of Book-to-Movie Literary Adaptations

## Outline
This project concentrates on the economic implications of adapting books into movies, analyzing how these adaptations influence box office performance and audience engagement, and outweigh the heavy production costs (ex: buying the rights to the film). The study will evaluate the financial outcomes of these adaptations, looking at different standalone adaptations and series and their success rates, and how well these films do in domestic versus international markets. It will also consider the indirect effects on the visibility and longevity of the source books, and therefore publishers, creating a win-win scenario for both.
Objective: To provide a data-driven narrative that informs stakeholders in both the publishing and film industries of the significant benefits of book-to-movie adaptations, encouraging more thoughtful and faithful adaptation practices that respect the source material while maximizing economic and cultural impact.


## Initial Sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The Data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and Medium
I will use Tableau and Shorthand for this project. I may also use Canva, or other graphic-generating sources to incorporate single-point-in-time statistics to call out various facts and figures where necessary.
